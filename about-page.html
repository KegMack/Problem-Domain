      <p> We are an unorganized band of philanthropist underachievers who want to share this amazing invention with the world, at no cost to the user.  There are thousands of children in the U.S. and other third-world countries who do not have access art classes, a ruler, or any form of a straight-edge, and thus cannot draw good UML Diagrams.

        <br/>We've all seen the TV ads with children who are starving and crying. <br/><br/> This is undoubtedly due to their inability to draw legible UML Diagrams.  Now, all they need is a new computer with broadband internet access, html-5, javascript, and the ability to read and write English.  <br/> <br/> <strong> World problem solved!! </strong></p>
